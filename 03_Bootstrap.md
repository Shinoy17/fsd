# Bootstrap

* A front-end framework for developing **mobile-first** for websites. 
  - You code goes inside the framework, referred to as inversion of control. Unlike library where you bring the library code into yours.
  - You can add your code to the framework in pre-defined ways, but the framework code in itself is not modifiable.
* It includes **pre-developed components** which enables faster development.
  - By default, some features are implemented. 
  - Even if you didn't add anything, something will show-up.
* It comes with **responsive 12 column** CSS grid system for layouts. 
* Bootstrap 5 is the current version.

The most important thing to learn is: how to reference the documentation. You don't have to memorize. The documentation is very easy with lots of examples.

Go to [Get Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
Two ways to work with Bootstrap.
1. Content Delivery Network (CDN) - Copy the CDN Link to the HTML file. [Getting Started](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) has the link to be included in the HTML page.
2. Download to local machine, save the on a folder and link to that. Do this only if you don't have access to the internet.
