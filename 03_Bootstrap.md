# Bootstrap

A very common framework for front-end web development. The most important thing to learn is: how to reference the documentation. You don't have to memorize. The documentation is very easy with lots of examples.

A framework has the following features.
* You code goes inside the framework (inversion of control). Unlike library where you the library code comes into your code.
* By default, some features are implemented. Even if you didn't add anything, something will show-up.
* You can add your code to the framework in a pre-determined points as required for your application.
* But the framework code in itself is not modifiable.
